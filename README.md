# Fingerprint-Biometric-Access-Control

## Repository Description:
This project is an access control system using fingerprint technology with an Arduino board and an electronic lock. It allows users to unlock the door or perform specific actions using their fingerprints. The project includes the following tools and components:

## Tools and Components:

- Arduino Board.
- Fingerprint Sensor.
- Keypad.
- LCD Display.
- Relay or an external device to control the electronic lock.
- Electronic Lock.

## Project Features:

- Reading fingerprints using a fingerprint sensor.
- Identifying registered fingerprints and verifying identity based on fingerprint comparison.
- Controlling the electronic lock to unlock or lock it upon recognizing the correct fingerprint.
- Detailed documentation of the fingerprint status and communication with the electronic lock and external device.
- Easy integration with security and access control projects.

## Instructions for Use:

1. Connect the fingerprint sensor to the data port on the Arduino board and connect the external device (relay and electronic lock) if you are using them.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE development environment.
3. Wait for the project to recognize the sensor and configure it successfully.
4. Place your finger on the fingerprint sensor to recognize and verify your identity.
5. If the correct fingerprint is recognized, the electronic lock will be controlled to unlock it.
